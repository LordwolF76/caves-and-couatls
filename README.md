This is my Roleplaying mod for Minecraft^TM.

A Player Character starts at level 1 with a 10 in each Ability Score, and receives 1 Ability point to Spend with each level up.

Ability scores will affect  attacks, saves, spellcasting, carry weight. Everything you do.

You will be able to pick a class, and subsequent subclasses, along with a secondary profession. (Cook, Alchemist, Woodcutter, Artificer, etc.)

You will earn Buffs and be Cursed with Banes. 

Good Luck adventurer.
